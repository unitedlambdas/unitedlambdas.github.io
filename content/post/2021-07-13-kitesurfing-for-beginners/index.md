Let's talk about kitesurfing.

When to kitesurf
-----------------
Reading the weather forecast is the first step. Optimally, the wind direction should be parallel to the beach (so-called *cross-shore* or *side-shore wind*). If the wind blows at an angle of about 45 degrees to the coast (*cross **on**-shore wind*) or less, it is acceptable for beginners.
Wind directions (e.g. south wind) are indicated by the direction from which the wind comes to an imaginary center.

Never go kitesurfing if the wind is even pointing slightly offshore.

Which kite
-----------
All kite manufacturers state on the packaging the standard wind range they recommend for use with that kite. This is based on the assumption that you weigh 75kg. To compensate for every 10 kg difference, add or subtract 1 mÂ² for the size of the kite or 1 m/s for the wind speed.

For example, if there's a 10 m kite, wind range 12 m/s, your weight is 95 kg, you can use this kite at a wind range of 14 m/s.

Larger kite sizes offer more pull, are more forgiving and handle gusty winds better. If you weigh more than 85 kg and surf in light winds, you should buy at least 13-14 m2.

Beginners should ask for a kite that has good depower, is easy and safe to relaunch and is durable.

For reference, I was wind surfing at 88 kg using a 12 RPM with a 145 x 44 Crazy Fly Allround and a wind range of 7-9 m/s.

Beach Checklist
----------------

Easiest way to determine wind direction is to turn your face into the wind. When you feel it blowing evenly on both sides of your cheeks, your nose will indicate the wind direction.
Kite's leading edge should be against the wind so that it is pushed down. Both when inflating and before launching.

* Check for tangles, look under the kite as the strings have loops (bridles) that can stick together if you are not careful.
* The red mark on the bar should be on the left. 
* Test to see if the safety release can be released.
* Attach the safety line.
* Have a friend lift it up.
* Go to 3 o'clock or 9 o'clock so that the leading edge is facing the wind. If the kite is still flapping, it means that it is not at the right angle to the wind.

The universal sign to release the kite for launch is the thumbs up.

Have fun kitesurfing!
